#### FUNCTIONS in this file:
## importNmMod
## .importNmModSingleProblem
## .mergeMissing

#' Parses a NONMEM control file, and returns its contents as a list of parsed elements.  These elements
#' will correspond to the actual control statements, e.g. $PK, $THETA, $PROBLEM, etc.  Some of the elements
#' are kept as pure text.
#' @title Parse a NONMEM control file
#' @param fileName File name name of the control file
#' @param path (optional) path to the control file, can be a stored path enclosed in round brackets
#' @param version NONMEM version that the control file targets.  Currently, "VII" or "7" denotes NONMEM 7, and
#' other values are not differentiated 
#' @param textReport Logical flag.  If TRUE, a message regarding which file is being imported will be logged.
#' @title Import a control file
#' @return A list with parsed components of the control file.  This will be of class \code{nmModel}.

#'  conContents <- importNmMod(file = "theoph.con", path = "examples/theoph") 
#'  print(conContents)

#' @note An execption will be generated if $PRIOR NWPRI is found in a control file and NONMEM version VII was used. If the control file is empty, 
#' an exception will also be generated.
